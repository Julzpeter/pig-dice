                <p>Pig dice is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die you win by
                    the first player
                    to reach 100 points or more. </p>


                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <div class="panel panel-default">
                        <h1>Game rules </h1>
                    </div>
                        <p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A player rolls the die repeatedly.The goal is to accumulate as many points as
                                    possible
                                </li>
                                <li>However, if a player rolls a 1, the players turn is over and any point they have
                                    accumulated during this turn is fortfeited.</li>
                                <li>Rolling a 1 doesnt wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total
                                    earned
                                    during that particular roll.</li>
                                <li>A player can also choose to hold,all of the points rolled during that turn are added
                                    to
                                    his or her score</li>
                                <li>When aplayer reaches a 100 points or more, the game ends and that player is a
                                    winner.
                                </li>
