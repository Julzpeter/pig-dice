                <h4>How to play</h4>
                <p>A player rolls the die repeatedly.The goal is to accumulate as many points as
                    possible.However, if a player rolls a 1, the players turn is over and any point they have
                    accumulated during this turn is fortfeited.
                    Rolling a 1 doesnt wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total
                    earned
                    during that particular roll
                    A player can also choose to hold,all of the points rolled during that turn are added
                    to
                    his or her score
                    When aplayer reaches a 100 points or more, the game ends and that player is a
                    winner.</p>
                <h4>How many players</h4>
                <p>The pig dice game is best with two players. It can also work with more players</p>
