            <h4>How to play</h4>
            <p>A player rolls the die repeatedly.The goal is to accumulate as many points as
                possible.However, if a player rolls a 1, the players turn is over and any point they have
                accumulated during this turn is fortfeited.
                Rolling a 1 doesnt wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just the total
                earned
                during that particular roll
                A player can also choose to hold,all of the points rolled during that turn are added
                to
                his or her score
                When aplayer reaches a 100 points or more, the game ends and that player is a
                winner.</p>
            <h4>How many players</h4>
            <p>The pig dice game is best with two players. It can also work with more players</p>
